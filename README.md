# music_in_motion

This is a webapp made for PennApps XVII. You can find the devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/music-in-motion-jd1rct). Essentially the webapp will transform a given song into a music video made entirely out of gifs. We do this by 

1. scraping the lyrics of the song from the closed captions of the song's youtube video
2. extracting the keywords from the lyrics
3. searching giphy for gifs using that lyrics' keywords
